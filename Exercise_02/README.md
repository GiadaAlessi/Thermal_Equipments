# Exercise 02 - Cascade Refrigeration Cycle Analysis

This project analyzes a **cascade refrigeration cycle** designed for a cold storage unit, featuring an ammonia-based top cycle and a CO‚ÇÇ-based bottom cycle. The system is evaluated using thermodynamic relations and CoolProp for property evaluation.

## üîç Project Overview
The project explores:
- Analysis of a **cascade cycle** using ammonia and CO‚ÇÇ as refrigerants.
- Evaluation of:
  - **Refrigerant mass flow rates**
  - **Vapor mass fraction** at the inlet of each evaporator
  - **Air outlet temperature** in the top cycle
  - **Compressor work** for both cycles
- Plotting of both cycles in the **T-s diagram**.
- A **parametric study** analyzing:
  - Influence of intermediate condenser temperatures
  - Effect of cooling demand variations
  - Refrigerant substitution with **R-1234ze** for improved sustainability and performance.

## üêç Python Code
The Python code implements:
- Thermodynamic calculations using **CoolProp** for accurate property evaluation.
- Mass flow rate and heat balance calculations for each stage of the cascade system.
- T-s diagram plotting to visualize cycle performance.
